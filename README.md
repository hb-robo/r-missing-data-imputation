# MATH459-Final-Project
My final project from MATH 459 - Statistical Bioinformatics. It's an R pipeline that takes in family-associated genomic data and arbitrarily removes some data points to test various missing data imputation methods for their accuracy. If I could do this project over, I probably would have imputed fake data on the sets that were incomplete instead of tossing them, so the sample size would be increased. As this project is more of a way to evaluate missing data imputation functions, the "validity" of the data is not really that important. A research-style paper was also submitted alongside the code and can be found below.
